#+TITLE: RefinedRobin
#+DESCRIPTION: Chrome extension for automated form filling on claude.ai with document saving

* About

RefinedRobin is a Chrome extension that automates form filling on claude.ai by capturing the current page's URL and text content, then navigating to Claude.ai, filling the form with this data plus a predefined message, submitting it, and automatically saving Claude's response.

* Dependencies

** Required Chrome Extension
RefinedRobin relies on the [[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-exporter-save-clau/elhmfakncmnghlnabnolalcjkdpfjnin][Claude Exporter]] extension to save Claude's responses. Install it from the Chrome Web Store before using RefinedRobin.

*Note:* The document saving functionality uses a strategy pattern, so future versions may support alternative saving methods without requiring the Claude Exporter extension.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd refinedrobin
just setup
#+END_SRC

Load the =dist= directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build the extension
just build

# Development with auto-rebuild
just dev

# Clean up
just teardown
#+END_SRC

* Using the Extension

** Keyboard Shortcut (Recommended)
- Windows/Linux: =Ctrl+Shift+L=
- Mac: =Cmd+Shift+L=

** Alternative Methods
- Click the RefinedRobin icon in the Chrome toolbar
- Right-click the icon and select "Execute Automation"
- Open the popup and click "Execute Automation"

* Features

- *Single Keystroke Activation*: Use =Ctrl+Shift+L= (or =Cmd+Shift+L= on Mac) from any webpage
- *Smart Page Extraction*: Captures URL and clean text content (like =lynx -dump=)
- *Automated Navigation*: Opens Claude.ai in a new tab
- *Form Automation*: Fills and submits the form with captured data
- *Response Monitoring*: Detects when Claude finishes responding
- *Automatic Document Saving*: Saves Claude's response using Claude Exporter extension
- *Error Handling and Logging*: Comprehensive error handling with verbose logging
- *TypeScript Implementation*: Following SOLID principles for maintainable code

* How It Works

1. Press =Ctrl+Shift+L= on any webpage
2. Extension extracts the current page's URL and text content
3. Opens a new tab with =https://claude.ai/new=
4. Combines the URL, predefined message, and page content
5. Fills the Claude.ai form and submits it automatically
6. Monitors for Claude's response completion (detects "Retry" button)
7. Waits 30 seconds for response to stabilize
8. Automatically saves the response using Claude Exporter extension

* Architecture

The extension uses a clean pipeline architecture:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Page Extraction → Form Filling → Response Monitoring → Document Saving
#+END_SRC

** Document Saving Strategy
Currently uses =ClaudeExporterStrategy= which integrates with the Claude Exporter extension. The strategy pattern allows for future implementations like:
- Native browser downloads
- Cloud storage integration
- Custom API endpoints

* Troubleshooting

** Export functionality not working?
Ensure the [[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-exporter-save-clau/elhmfakncmnghlnabnolalcjkdpfjnin][Claude Exporter]] extension is installed and enabled. RefinedRobin will gracefully degrade if the extension is unavailable, still providing form automation without document saving.
